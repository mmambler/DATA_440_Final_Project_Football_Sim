# DATA_440_Final_Project_Football_Sim

My final project idea is to use the data from my independent study to create a football game simulator that allows a user to take on the role of an offensive coordinator and decide whether to run or pass the ball on a given play, and a model will return the outcome of that play, whether that be a number of yards gained, a touchdown, a turnover, etc. This outcome will then be used to update the game situation and the user is given the chance to choose once more. The simulation will operate on a play-clock, and it will result in either a win or a loss.
